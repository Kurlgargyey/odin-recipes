This project is a practice of every HTML concept I learned so far in the TOP curriculum.
It employs:
- relative linking to images and webpages
- bold and italic formatting
- ordered and unordered lists
- paragraphs and headings
- the HTML boilerplate (duh)

Furthermore, I looked up how to resize the images with HTML myself, because it was getting a bit too annoying.
