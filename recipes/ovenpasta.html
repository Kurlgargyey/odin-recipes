  <h1>Feta Cheese Oven Pasta</h1>
  <img src="../images/fetapasta.jpg">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe is based around making the pasta sauce in the oven.
    The sauce uses <strong>feta cheese</strong> 
    (vegan alternatives work fine also!) and <strong>tomatoes</strong>. 
    This combination is spiced up by the addition of some <em>fresh basil</em> 
    and the usual <em>salt and pepper</em>. If you like to eat spicy, you can add 
    some <em>chilis</em>, too. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients (makes several days' worth)</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>500g Pasta</li>
   <li>200g (one block) Vegan Feta Cheese</li>
   <li>200g Tomatoes</li>
   <li>Oil</li>
   <li>Basil</li>
   <li>Garlic however you like it (minced works well)</li>
   <li>Salt</li>
   <li>Pepper</li>
   <li>Chilis (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Lightly coat a small-to-medium size baking dish with <em>oil</em>. 
     Place the <strong>cheese</strong> in the middle of the pan 
     and fill out the rest of it with <strong>tomatoes</strong>.
     Drizzle cheese and tomatoes with <em>oil</em>. Add <em>salt and pepper</em>. If you
     want, add the <em>chilis</em> here.
     Bake for around 30 minutes or until the tomatoes are starting to collapse.</li>
    <li>While you're baking the sauce, cook up the <strong>pasta</strong> however you like or according
     to the instructions on the package.</li>
    <li>Once the <strong>sauce</strong> is done, take it out of the 
     oven and combine it with <strong>pasta</strong>. You may want to give the sauce a 
     bit of a stir before you combine. If the pasta is not done yet 
     for some reason, just make sure you don't bake the sauce too much while you wait.</li>
    <li>Add the <em>basil</em>, <em>garlic</em> and whichever other herbs you like and give it one last mix!</li>
    <li>Enjoy!!</li>
