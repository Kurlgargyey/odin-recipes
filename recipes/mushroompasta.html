  <h1>Mushroom Sauce One Pot Pasta</h1>
  <img src="../images/mushroompasta.webp">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>For this recipes, the idea is to make it all in one pot, so it's very easy to do!
   You just gradually add in the ingredients in the correct order, wait a bit
   and there you go! It's a simple <strong>pasta</strong> dish, using a <strong>coconut
   milk</strong> base for the sauce and some strong flavoring ingredients like <em>soy
   sauce</em>, <em>chilis</em>, <em>vegetable broth</em>
    and of course <strong>mushrooms</strong>.
  </p>
 <h2>Ingredients (makes several days' worth)</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>500g Pasta</li>
  <li>400ml Coconut Milk</li>
  <li>200g Tomatoes</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Basil</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Pepper</li>
  <li>Chilis (optional)</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
   <li>Lightly coat a small-to-medium size baking dish with <em>oil</em>. 
    Place the <strong>cheese</strong> in the middle of the pan 
    and fill out the rest of it with <strong>tomatoes</strong>.
    Drizzle cheese and tomatoes with <em>oil</em>. Add <em>salt and pepper</em>. If you
    want, add the <em>chilis</em> here.
    Bake for around 30 minutes or until the tomatoes are starting to collapse.</li>
   <li>While you're baking the sauce, cook up the <strong>pasta</strong> however you like or according
    to the instructions on the package.</li>
   <li>Once the <strong>sauce</strong> is done, take it out of the 
    oven and combine it with <strong>pasta</strong>. You may want to give the sauce a 
    bit of a stir before you combine. If the pasta is not done yet 
    for some reason, just make sure you don't bake the sauce too much while you wait.</li>
   <li>Add the <em>basil</em> and whichever other herbs you like and give it one last mix!</li>
   <li>Enjoy!!</li>
