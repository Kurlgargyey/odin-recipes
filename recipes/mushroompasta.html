  <h1>Mushroom Sauce One Pot Pasta</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>For this recipes, the idea is to make it all in one pot, so it's very easy to do!
   You just gradually add in the ingredients in the correct order, wait a bit
   and there you go! It's a simple <strong>pasta</strong> dish, using a <strong>coconut
   milk</strong> base for the sauce and some strong flavoring ingredients like <em>soy
   sauce</em>, <em>chilis</em>, <em>vegetable broth</em>
    and of course <strong>mushrooms</strong>.
  </p>
 <h2>Ingredients (makes several days' worth)</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>500g pasta</li>
  <li>400ml coconut milk</li>
  <li>2-3 shalottes</li>
  <li>6-8 cloves of garlic</li>
  <li>Chilis to taste</li>
  <li>200g mushrooms of your liking</li>
  <li>Spinach to taste</li>
  <li>A bit of soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 blocks of instant vegetable broth</li>
  <li>Nutritional yeast</li>
  <li>Dried tomatoes</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
   <li>Cut the chilis, shalottes and garlic however you like them, although I recommend
    mincing them as finely as you can get it. Add to the pot with a bit of oil
    and cook until they're soft and the shalottes are nicely browned. You might have 
    to splash in some water from time to time to make sure that nothing sticks to the 
    pot. But don't overdo it. Just pay close attention to this part, because it's all 
    fucked if you burn the shalottes.
   </li>
   <li>Once the shalottes are browned, cover the bottom of the pot with water (just 
    enough to stop the shalottes from frying) and dissolve the broth cubes.
   </li>
   <li>Next, add the coconut milk and nutritional yeast, give it a stir, then add soy
    sauce, mushroom, dried tomatoes and pasta. The pasta should still 
    be just barely covered by the coconut milk. If they aren't, add a bit more 
    coconut milk. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the pasta is 
    cooked to your liking. Stir it from time to time so nothing sticks to the pot. 
    You may have to add your spinach here, check the next step for 
    more info.
   </li>
   <li>If you have fresh leafy spinach, add your spinach once the pasta is done cooking 
    and give it another stir. If you are using frozen spinach, you should have added it 
    earlier with the other ingredients.
   </li>
   <li>Enjoy!!</li>
