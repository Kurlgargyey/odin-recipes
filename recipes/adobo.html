  <h1>Vegan Adobo</h1>
  <img src="../images/veganadobo.jpg" alt="A bowl of rice, topped by some shredded seitan in a copious amount of light brown sauce">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe is all about acidity. It uses an almost scary amount of vinegar to really 
   bring a <em>punch</em> to the dish. In this vegan variant, the usual bits of meat are 
   replaced by some shredded seitan. You will need three different pans to make this.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients (makes several days' worth)</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>400g rice</li>
   <li>400ml <strong>creamy</strong> coconut milk</li>
   <li>2-3 shalottes</li>
   <li>6-8 cloves of garlic</li>
   <li>Chilis to taste</li>
   <li>200g shredded seitan</li>
   <li>50ml Rice vinegar</li>
   <li>35 ml soy sauce</li>
   <li>15ml light soy sauce</li>
   <li>Nutritional yeast</li>
   <li>20g sugar</li>
   <li>ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Cut the <strong>chilis</strong>, <strong>shalottes</strong> and <strong>garlic</strong> however you like them, although I recommend
    mincing them as finely as you can get it. Add to the pot with a bit of oil
    and cook until they're soft. Do not brown the <em>shalottes</em> more than a little bit.
   </li>
   <li>Once the <em>shalottes</em> are soft, add the <strong>coconut milk</strong>, 
   <strong>nutritional yeast</strong>, <strong>sugar</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong>, 
   give it a stir,
   then add the <strong>soy sauce</strong> and <strong>vinegar</strong>. 
   At this point, the vinegar might release a pretty overwhelming smell, but don't 
   worry. It will mellow out! Let this simmer for 20 minutes.
   </li>
   <li>While the sauce is simmering, brown the <strong>seitan</strong> in a pan 
   with some oil and prepare the <strong>rice</strong> however you like it.
   </li>
   <li>Once the <em>seitan</em> is done, toss it in with the sauce and let it cook for 
   another 5 minutes.
   </li>
   <li>Finally, serve the adobo together with your rice. Garnish to your liking.</li>
   <li>Enjoy!!</li>
  </ol>
